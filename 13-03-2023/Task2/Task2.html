    <h1>OOPs concept in TypeScript</h1>
    <h2>Abstraction</h2>
    Abstraction is the process of hiding the internal details of an application from the outer world. Abstraction is
    used to describe things in simple terms. It's used to create a boundary between the application and the client
    programs.

    <h2>Polymorpism</h2>
    Polymorphism is a feature of object-oriented programming languages that allows a specific routine to use variables
    of different types at different times.
    <strong>Polymorphism can be achived by: <br> Method OverLoading (Compile Time Polymorphism) <br> Method Overriding
        (Runtime Polymorphism) </strong>

    <h2>Encapsulation</h2>
    Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together
    code and the data it manipulates. Another way to think about encapsulation is, that it is a protective shield that
    prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.
    <strong>Getters and Setters are used to access private member og the class </strong>
