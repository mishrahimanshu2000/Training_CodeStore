        Interface and enums
    </h1>
    <h2>
        Interface
    </h2>
    <p>
        Interfaces define properties, methods, and events, which are the members of the interface. <br> Interfaces contain
        only the declaration of the members. It is the responsibility of the deriving class to define the members. <br> It
        often helps in providing a standard structure that the deriving classes would follow.

    <h2>
        Enums
    </h2>
    <p>
        An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables).
        <br>
        Enums come in two flavors string and numeric.
        <br>
        Enums are also used to define the different states of an object
        <br>
        By default enum values starts with 0 and increment themself by 1
