        <p>

                <h3>Selector</h3>
                <p>A selector is HTML tag at which the style is applied. This could be any tag like : &lth2>, &lttable> etc.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Property</h3>
                <p>A Property is a type of attribute of HTML tag at which a style will be applied. HTML attribute is converted into CSS Property. This could be color, border, etc.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Value</h3>
                <p>Value are assigned to Property.
                    For example color property have the Value either red or #f1f1f1 etc.
                </p>
            </div>
            You can put CSS style rule syntax  as follows : <br>
            <pre class="codeEx">   selector{ property : value }</pre>
            Example:
            <pre class="codeEx">   table{border: 1px solid black}</pre>

            <strong>
                We can define selectors in various different ways based on our comfort. Few of them are: <br>
            </strong>
            <h4>1. Element/Type Selectors:</h4>
            This is the selector in which the Element or tag  is selected and styled. <br>
            Example : To give a color to all level 1 heading:
            <pre class="codeEx">
                h1{
                    color : red
                }</pre>
        </article>


        <article>
            <h4>2. Id Selector:</h4>
            <p>
                we can define the style rules based on the <em>id</em> attribute of the Element. All the Elements having that <em>id</em> will be formatted according to defined rules.
                <pre class="codeEx">
                    #black{
                        color : #000000
                    }</pre>
            </p>
        </article>


        <article>
            <h4>3. Class Selector:</h4>
            <p>
                we can define style rule based on class attribute of the Element.
                All element having that class will be formatted according to defined rule.
                <pre class="codeEx">
                    .black{
                        color : black
                    }</pre>
                the above rule will render the content in black for every element with class attribute set to <em>black</em> in our HTML document. <br><br>
                To make it bit more particular
                <pre class="codeEx">
                    h1.black{
                        color : #000000
                    }</pre>
                this rule will render the content in black for only &lth1> Elements with class attribute set to black
            </p>
        </article>


        <article>
            <h4>4. Universal Selector</h4>
            <p>
                Rather then selecting elements of specific type, the universal selector quite simply matches the name of any element type:
                <pre class="codeEx">
                    *{
                        color : black
                    }</pre>
            </p>
        </article>
    </main>
