// All var, let, const all the three keywords are used to declare and create Variable in JavaScript

var:
    var has the global scope, even if we declare var inside a block then also we will be getting its value globally

let:
    value assigned using the let keyword cannot be redeclared 

    but can be reassiged

    let is block scoped means variable declared using let keyword cant be used and accessed outside the block in which it is declared

const
    Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.

    Variables defined with const have Block Scope.
